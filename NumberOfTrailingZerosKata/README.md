Number of trailing zeros of N!
===========

Write a program that will calculate the number of trailing zeros in a factorial of a given number.

N! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 ... N

```
zeros(12) = 2 # 1 * 2 * 3 .. 12 = 479001600 
that has 2 trailing zeros 4790016(00)
```

Be careful 1000! has length of 2568 digital numbers.
